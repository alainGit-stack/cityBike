# Project Description

This project includes Java classes and other necessary files to run the program. All the Java classes are located in the `src` directory. Additionally, you will find CSV files and `.bat` files within the repository. These files have been essential for the program to function, as the CSV files contain the input data, while the `.bat` files assist with various program tasks and processes.

### Files Overview:

- **`src/` directory**: Contains the Java source files that define the core functionality of the program.
  
- **CSV files**: These files are used by the program to read data or output results. They play a crucial role in processing information within the program.

- **`.bat files`**: Batch files used for automating specific operations and tasks in the program, ensuring a smoother execution process.

This repository is designed to help manage and interact with these files in order to run the program efficiently and perform various operations based on the data provided.
